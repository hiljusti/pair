# Pair

A simple pair and drop-in shim for the beloved `javafx.util.Pair` that was
included in JDK 8. (And is still available in the [JavaFX project](https://openjfx.io/))

Note: The shim provided here is not exactly-equal (e.g. the hashCode() is not
hand-written), but _is_ equivalent in the sense that it has the same package
path, class, method names, and behavior.
